# bigraphix

Goal: Use self-made library graphix.py (SEPARATE REPO) to call functions and display data retrieved from Binance via webscraping within bigraphix.py. Graphix will be a standalone to display candle chart data using open,close,high,low for any data, bigraphix will retrieve crypto pair data and display it using graphix.py functions.

(bigraphix.py) v0.0.1: Uses graphix.py library to generate grid + a candle with high line. 

Both libraries will be updated on an identical basis, so that bigraphix v0.0.1 integrates with graphix v0.0.1 functions etc. Using bigraphix will not necessarily require an identical version of graphix, and vice versa, but differentiating versions could potentially cause issues if more recent versions of bigraphix rely on bug fixes in future versions of graphix that update older functions.
